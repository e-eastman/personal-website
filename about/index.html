                        <p>Hi, I'm Erica and thanks for visiting my site! I work at the intersection of technology and creativity to help businesses grow.</p>
                        <p>I majored in Art History because of my passion for good design. I combined my creativity with an aptitude for technology by spending most of my career in CRM database management for non-profits in the Arts sector. Over the years, I dabbled in blogging and started and deleted more websites than I can count! As soon as the site was live I would quickly lose interest.</p>
                        <p>It wasn't until recently that I realized my passion for building websites was just that - the act of creation using technology to make an idea come to life! The lightbulb went off that I should get back into coding and pursue Front-end Development, where I could combine technology and structure with the art of creating something new.</p>
                        <p>I love helping clients strategize on building their brand and business and helping them achieve their vision through Digital Marking and Website Development. It's great to have a career where I'm constantly being intellectually challenged to solve problems and learn new things.</p>
                        <p>Whenever I'm not busy staring at a screen, you can find me outside enjoying nature, and attempting to garden while the wildlife destroy all my efforts. I enjoy trying to take decent photos and miss my days of living in NYC where you are constantly presented with new and interesting street views. I also enjoy lounging on the couch with a good read and a cozy cat nearby.</p>
